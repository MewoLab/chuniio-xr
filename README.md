# ChuniXR IO

Not enough is complete for me to give instructions on how to set it up, but I can explain the plans.

## Plans

- [ ] One DLL is put into ChuniXR which can interface with S\*\*\*tools' Chuni LED pipe and eventually interface with...
- [ ] Two DLLS set as the IO for Chuni (AMD\*\*\*mon & Chu\*\*n) which talks to the ChuniXR DLL.

Lot of work to do, eh?
